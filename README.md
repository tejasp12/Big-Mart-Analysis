# Big-Mart-Sales_Analysis: A Multiple Linear Regression Problem
## Domain:Retail
## How I approched the problem and built a Regression Model to predict the sales:
### Problem Statement:
  We have a data of One Thousand Five Hundred and Fifty Nine products across 10 stores of Big-Mart chain in 10 cities.The aim is to build a Predictive Model and find out the sale of each product at a perticular store.
### Value to Business:
  Using this predictive model,the decision makers of the BigMart will try to understand the properties of various products and stores which play an important and key role in increasing sale. 
Let's first try to understand what could affect the target variable "Sales"?
1. The day of the week - Weekends are tend to more busier than weekdays
2. The time of the day - Morning or late evening
3. At the End of the Year or any special occasions
4. Store size and location
5. Items with more shelf space sell more.

The whole solution is divided into 8 parts namely:
1. Get the Training data.
2. Clean the Training dataset.
3. Explore the Training dataset and perform feature engineering.
4. Get the Testining data and do the same treatments that performed on Training dataset.
5. Build the Model.
6. Perform Predictions.
7. Evaluate the Model with error metrics.
8. Final words on **Improvement of Model's Predictive Power.**
